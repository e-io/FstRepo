## First repository/Первый репозиторий
Learning objectives/Учебные задачи

This repository is created for different programs, which I do just for self-learning in programming

Probably, you can't find here something difficult or super-interesting, but you can see my learning progress in something.

Perhaps, I will create another repository with clear name "Playground" or something like this

This is desription for some of these programs:

```
├── Go
│   ├── guessnumber.go - simple game for '<' and '>' for console on golang
├── Python
│   ├── crypt - simple program, which use simplecrypt library to decrypt a message
│   ├── timecounter.py - this program counts time "xx hours xx minutes xx seconds"
│   ├── 'codecombat - mountain flower grove.py' - my answer for one of codecombat.com problems 
│   ├── searchpy.py - this programs searchs for all .py files inside current directories
├── SQL
│   ├── sql requests for sql-ex.txt - some solved problems from sql-ex.ru (SQL)
```
